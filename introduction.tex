Strings form a fundamental data type in computer systems and  string joins find all string pairs between two input string collections.  String joins are essential operations in
many applications, such as  data integration \cite{conf/sigmod/Sarawagi04}, data cleansing \cite{conf/vldb/ArasuGK06,journals/www/LiJM06} and data exploration. Conceptually, there are two types of string joins: exact joins and approximate joins. Exact joins mean that two matching strings should be exactly the same, while approximate joins tolerate certain difference
  between two strings and the similarity of two strings can be measured by a similarity function, such as  $n$-gram similarity~\cite{conf/spire/Kondrak05}, Levenshtein Distance
\cite{journals/pvldb/XiaoWL08,conf/sigmod/WangLF12}, Jaro-Winkler
measure~\cite{Winkler99thestate}, Jaccard
similarity~\cite{conf/icde/ChaudhuriGK06}, cosine
similarity~\cite{journals/ipm/SaltonB88}.


 Taxonomies are sets of IS-A hierarchies, which identify the relations between different concepts. For example, Figure \ref{fig:taxonomy} shows an example of taxonomy for geographical concepts. However, to the best of our knowledge, the integration of taxonomy information in data used for classifier training has never been investigated so far.




Given two strings, $s_1$ and $s_2$, we return three possible relationships between $s_1$ and $s_2$: hypernym, hyponym, mixed. For example, ``California, U.S.'' is a hyponym of ``U.S.'', ``Egypt'' is the same as ``Egypt, Africa Northern'' and ``Egypt'' is a hypernym of ``Africa''. For more examples: ``Egypt, Algeria'' is a hyponym of ``Africa Northern''.

There are two related problems: string join with taxonomy and string similarity join with taxonomy

The leave behind two intriguing questions:

1. How to efficient process string joins with taxonomy? And for multiple joins.


2. How to process the similarity joins and multiple-way similarity joins?  This question becomes increasingly urgent nowadays with the arrival of big data.

%\begin{problem}(String measure with taxonomy). Given two strings $s_1$ and $s_2$ and a taxonomy $T$, how to measure the similarity between $s_1$ and $s_2$ based on T?
%\end{problem}
%\begin{problem}(String joins with taxonomy). Given a string $p$$\in$
%$\Sigma^*$, an integer k, and a synonym set $\mathbb{R}$,  .
%\end{problem}




\subsection{Novelty and contributions}


\smallskip


Our contributions are as follows.

\noindent \textbf{Introduction of string joins with taxonomy}. We introduce a new problem to utilize the taxonomy for the string joins in databases, which has application in data integration and data cleansing.

\noindent \textbf{Optimal algorithms for string joins} We introduce a holistic algorithm for multiple string joins.

\noindent \textbf{Introduction of approximate string joins with taxonomy}: Provide three relationships Hyper, Hypo and mixed similarity.

\noindent \textbf{Novel algorithms for approximate string joins}


Finally, we perform experiments to evaluate our results and show the benefits of proposal algorithms.

The rest of this paper is organized as follows. Section 2
provides the necessary definitions, formulates . Section
3 includes our algorithm for exact joins with taxonomy. In Section 4, we study
the approximate string join, proposing our solution, analyzing its approximation
ratio, and presenting our similarity join algorithms.
Our experiments are presented in Section 5. Finally,
Section 6 concludes with a discussion about future work.
