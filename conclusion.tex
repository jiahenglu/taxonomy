\section{Conclusion}

In this paper, we have presented a framework which uses the taxonomy to support string joins. We introduced a new similarity measurement based on the maximum weighted matching on bipartite graphs and develop a set of efficient string join algorithms. In particular, we  
 studied a NP-had problem of how to maximize the filtering power under the filtering time constraints. We develop a probabilistic approximate algorithm to computet the results very fast with theoretical guarantees. Our algorithms are extensively experimented using real datasets and are shown to be effective and robust.
