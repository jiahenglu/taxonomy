\section{Conclusion}

In this paper, we presented a framework which use the exsting taxonomy to perform exact and approximate.
concepts included.

We introduce a new query type, approximate string join, with taxonomy. We propose processing
models for taxonomy queries, and introduce how to build
an additional index (besides the inverted index) to support
efficient query processing. In particular, we study the problem
of how to optimize this additional index based on a
workload of queries, with the goal of minimizing query processing
cost, and propose algorithms with performance guarantees.
Our index optimization techniques are tested using
real datasets and are shown to be effective and robust.
