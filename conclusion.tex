\section{Conclusion}

In this paper, we have presented a framework which uses the taxonomy to support string joins. We introduced a new similarity measurement based on the maximum weighted matching on bipartite graphs and develop a set of efficient string join algorithms. We develop an adaptive sample algorithm to select the high-quality filters efficiently. Our algorithms are extensively experimented using real datasets and are shown to be effective and robust.
