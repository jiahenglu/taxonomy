@Comment This is a global file for bibtex references. To use it, include it
@Comment in your main latex file.  In addition, create a local bibtex file
@Comment called "localrefs.bib", and add new bibtex entries to the local
@Comment files.

@Comment After finishing the writing, merge the bibtex references in
@Comment localrefs.bib into this file.  Resolve any conflict if any.

@Comment We will use the naming convention used by DBLP.  The following are
@Comment two examples:

@Comment http://dblp.uni-trier.de/rec/bibtex/conf/vldb/LiWY07
@Comment http://dblp.uni-trier.de/rec/bibtex/journals/tods/LiC01

@Comment Notice that to save space, we do not want to include the "DBLP:"
@Comment prefix for each key.

@Comment Make sure to insert the new bibtex entries following the alphabet
@Comment order of the key entries.

@Comment For those references not appeared on DBLP, we will decide the
@Comment naming convention soon.

@Comment The entries start from here.
