%For example, in XML keyword query refinement, each
%keyword is associated with a set of alternative terms.  Each term is
%associated with an inverted list containing the occurrences and the
%weights of the corresponding elements in the XML database. The
%\topkm{} queries return top-$k$ refined keyword combinations
%according to the corresponding \mbox{top-$m$} search results of keyword
%queries. In general, \topkm{} queries are useful in scenarios
%where the problem of selecting \emph{combinations
%of attributes} associated with ranked inverted lists naturally occurs.

\begin{abstract}

A string similarity join finds all similar pairs between two input string collections. It is an essential operation in
many applications, such as data integration, data cleansing and information extraction. This paper investigates a challenge to integrate taxonomy information with string similarity joins. In principle, taxonomies present a semantic strategy to improve the effectiveness of string joins by enriching data with a set of IS-A hierarchies.


%We study two  relevant problems for string similarity joins with
%taxonomies: (1) how to measure the similarity between two strings with
%taxonomies  and (2) how to perform efficient string joins with
%taxonomies. To tackle the first problem, we develop a new measurement by extending the longest common
%prefixes with maximum
%weighted matching on bipartite graphs. We show three attractive
%properties, called 3C's, \textit{Constructive}, \textit{Compatible}
%and \textit{Consistent}, that our new measurement guarantees. Second,
%to support the efficient string joins, we present a filter,  called
%\textit{Semantics-Similar filters}, to prune away irrelevant pairs
%effectively. Our technical contribution here is to develop an adaptive
%sampling algorithm, which judiciously select a small set of strings
%based on the hardness of join data, to maximize the filtering power,
%under the filtering time constraints.  The extensive performance
%evaluations show that our algorithms can utilize taxonomies to improve
%the effectiveness of string joins  and  scale very well with important
%parameters like data size and taxonomy size.


The starting point of this paper is to investigate a special case
where any string matches only one node in a taxonomy tree.  Based on  similarity functions with the longest common prefixes, we
propose a worst-case optimal join algorithm by using an extended trie
structure, running within the linear cost bound of the input and output data.
Then we move to a  general scenario where one string can match
multiple nodes in a taxonomy tree. To this end, we define  new similarity functions by
extending longest common prefixes with maximum matching on bipartite
graphs.  We develop a similarity join algorithm with a novel filter, called Semantics-Similar Filters (SSF), to prune
away irrelevant pairs effectively. One technical challenge in this filter is to judiciously select the filtering similarity threshold to maximize the filtering power. We prove that  this problem in general is NP-hard.  We develop an efficiently adaptive
sampling algorithm, which judiciously select a small set of strings
based on the hardness of join data, to maximize the SSF's filtering power,
under the filtering time constraints.  The extensive performance
evaluations show that our algorithms can utilize taxonomies to improve
the effectiveness of string joins  and  scale very well with important
parameters like data size and taxonomy size.




%If a string matches only one node in a taxonomy tree, we employ the longest common prefix (LCP) of two nodes in a taxonomy tree to measure their similarity and develop two families of join algorithms with sorted lists and compact tries, which explore different alternatives for the trade-off between space and time complexity. Then for a generalized case, when a string matches multiple nodes in a taxonomy tree,

% We show three interesting properties, called the three C's: \textit{Constructive}, \textit{Compatible} and \textit{Consistent}, that our new measurement guarantees.  We develop a set of new algorithms to perform the efficient string similarity joins based on different index structures, including sorted lists, compact tries and LS-trees, which explore different alternatives for the trade-off between space and time complexity. Given a query workload, we formulate an optimization problem
%which chooses the best parameters, aiming at maximum filtering power, under the filtering time constraints. We show the NP-hardness of the problem, and propose a space-efficient approximate algorithm to find the solution very efficiently.


\end{abstract}

%The technique relies on the insight that two strings are similar if they share certain number of common ancestors in the taxonomy tree.
